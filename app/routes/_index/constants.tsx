            My journey in programming began at 13, sparked by a love for game
            development. I started with C++{' '}
            <em>(a bold choice, even for the time)</em>, then moved on to C# for
            the Unity Engine. Although I enrolled in a Computer Science program
            at Florida Polytechnic University, I left one year before completion
            due to difficult financial issues within my family. Shortly after
            and in response to changes in the game development industry, I
            learned Javascript and TypeScript, which led me into software
            engineering.

            Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Lightcast on the Phantom
            Team, where I explore and create new AI technologies. I am
            laser-focused on creating reliable software and am a massive
            proponent of almost all kinds of software testing.

        <h3 className="pt-6 text-xl">
            Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and have visited over 15 states.
            Some of my favorite places include the Parthenon in Nashville, TN,
            the Savannah River Rapids Park in Augusta, GA and, as an amusement
            park enthusiast, Carowinds in Charlotte, NC!
